#multivariate model
#Videos I used: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef0efKL1Els and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1RD5ECsSB0

#models
model1 <- lm(gdp~prod)
model2 <- lm(gdp~oilprice)
model3 <- lm(gdp~prod+oilprice)
#model 3 should be the important one 

summary(model1)
summary(model2)
summary(model3)
#My try to interpret this:
#p-value has to be <0.05 so we can reject the Hypothesis that the model does not predict anything.
#holds for model1 & model3
#R spared is really bad in all 3: 0.018, 0.004, 0.028
#in model 3 the oilprice is not significant (no *) & prod only has one *

#with this we get many nice looking plots
plot(model1)
plot(model2)
plot(model3)
#from model 3 we can see that we have "AusreiÃŸer" in the obs. 244, 245 & 246
#so May to July 2020? Would make sence with Corona. 

#next we can comp
ute the confidence intervals for the model coefficients
confint(model1, conf.level=0.95)
confint(model2, conf.level=0.95)
confint(model3, conf.level=0.95)
#No idea if this tells us anything 

#Here we can check the correlation between the X variables
cor(oilprice, prod, method = "pearson")
#[1] -0.1959896 --> seems ok to me?
